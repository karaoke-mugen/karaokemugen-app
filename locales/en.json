			"Don't bother your neighbors!",
			"Remember to make pauses to aerate the room once in a while!",
			"Don't accept any money if someone wants his/her song to play before it should. Fresh drinks and food are much better!",

			"Need to send a message to your public? The message option will show a text on their mobile devices and/or on the karaoke screen!",

			"You can accept or refuse songs in the public playlist. To do this, display the public and current playlist side by side.",
			"Accepting a public suggestion gives back song quota to the user who requested it, and adds the song in the current playlist!",
			"Refusing a public suggestion gives back song quota to the user who requested it, and keeps the song in the public playlist so it can't be requested again!",
			"When you search, you can put a word group between double quotes to ask precisely for that text. Type in \"love live\" to have karaokes from Love Live series only."
