# How to contribute

Every good will is welcome.

To see how you can help, check :

- [Documentation](http://docs.karaokes.moe)
- [Create an issue or try to resolve one!](https://lab.shelter.moe/karaokemugen/karaokemugen-app/issues)
- [Come to our Discord!](https://karaokes.moe/discord)

Please read the following before contributing :

## Branches

When trying to work on a new feature or issue, remember there are two main branches to base your new branch/work off :

- `master` should be used when fixing bugs in the currently running version of Karaoke Mugen. Your fix will be included in the next "bugfix" release.
- `next` should be used when adding new features or fixing non-urgent bugs.

`master` is regularly merged within `next` when we make bugfixes on it. `next` is merged back on `master` only when doing major release versions.

So if you want to work  on a new feature for example, create a branch from `next`.

## Coding

Please respect coding conventions already in place as much as possible.

- Use of async/await instead of .then/.catch and callbacks
- Use `for..of` or `for..in` loops instead of `.forEach` unless your forEach is not using async functions or is a oneliner
- Use TypeScript
- Use import module syntax, not the require one
- Before adding a dependency, ask on Discord if it should really be added. Who knows, someone might have an idea on how to avoid using it, or a better alternative.

## Workflow

### Issues approval

If an issue needs to be fixed, a milestone will be added to it by a maintainer. At this point anyone can take the issue and work on it.

If an issue is closed but has not been fixed and could be reopened, please add a comment to it and wait for a maintainer to reopen it.

### Working on an issue

When starting work on an issue, **DO NOT** use the "Create merge request" button as it'll create a new branch on `master` by default. **DO** use the arrow next to it to create your new branch from the `next` branch instead.

### Merging

Once your work is ready, remove the `WIP` label at the beginning of the merge request title and add a comment to tell maintainers this is ready to merge.

Maintainers will usually merge by squashing the commits inside the branch unless explicitely stated otherwise.
